        <p style="width: 40%">We are Naomi and Anna Jaffe, partners and managers of Tuition Hot Sauce. As sisters, we have our fights. Nevertheless, we are always able to forgive each other and remain close which is why we make perfect business partners. Along with our passion for entrepreneurship, we share a love of locally sourced products. That is why we grow all of our hot peppers in our backyard for the freshest ingredients for our hot sauces. Outside of our hot sauce business, we attend school at Fairview High School. Go Knights!</p>

        <p class="align-right" style="width: 40%">Our hot sauce requires the best hot peppers to acquire the perfect taste and quality. Our most popular peppers are red thai chili, habanero, jalapeno, and anaheim. We grow all of our peppers in our own garden; no pesticides, all organic, and in great hands. Additional ingredients for our hot sauces include vinegar and other organic vegetables. None of our hot sauces contain any sugar, preservatives, meat, or dairy products. They are all gluten free and vegan as well!</p>

        <p>â€‹Tuition Hot Sauce was officially established in May of 2016. The idea to make homemade hot sauce came to Naomi Jaffe when she was brainstorming ideas for what to do for her dad for his birthday. She knew that he put hot sauce in his eggs every morning so she decided that she would make her own hot sauce. Using the main ingredients commonly found in hot sauce, (vinegar and hot peppers) she decided to experiment and came up with a hot sauce that was quite sublime. In fact, it was so sublime that she decided to start a business with the help of her older sister, Anna Jaffe. She developed new flavors and techniques over time, in order to adapt to a larger audience of hot sauce lovers. To this day, she is still brainstorming new, original hot sauce flavors for everyone's taste.</p>
