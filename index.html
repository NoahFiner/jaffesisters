      <h1>about the business</h1>
      <p>â€‹Tuition Hot Sauce was officially established in May of 2016. The idea to make homemade hot sauce came to Naomi Jaffe when she was brainstorming ideas for what to do for her dad for his birthday. She knew that he put hot sauce in his eggs every morning so she decided that she would make her own hot sauce. Using the main ingredients commonly found in hot sauce, (vinegar and hot peppers) she decided to experiment and came up with a hot sauce that was quite sublime. In fact, it was so sublime that she decided to start a business with the help of her older sister, Anna Jaffe. She developed new flavors and techniques over time, in order to adapt to a larger audience of hot sauce lovers. To this day, she is still brainstorming new, original hot sauce flavors for everyone's taste.</p>
